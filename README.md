# Gomoku (Connect 5)

Inspired by this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYgyRArKDEs&list=PLFCB5Dp81iNV_inzM-R9AKkZZlePCZdtV&ab_channel=KeithGalli)

## How to play

Run gomoku.py.

### Basic rules:

1. There must be 2 players (Black & White)
2. Black always goes first.
3. Place Go pieces on the intersections of the grid lines.
4. Game pieces cannot be removed from the board once placed.
5. The goal is to connect 5 game pieces in a row first.
6. Horizontal, vertical, and diagonal connections are all considered a win.

### Tips for beginners:

1. Always watch for an open three.
2. Always block a four.
3. Avoid placing your pieces on the edges. You might get a three or a four that is already blocked.
4. You dont always have to block an open three. If you could create a four, your opponent has to block that four first before he could do anything with 
the open three he just created. Sometimes attacking can be the best defense.
5. Be strategic. Typically how players win the game is simultaneously creating an open three and a four in one move.

GL & HF!
