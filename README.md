## How to play

Run gomoku.py.

### Basic rules:

1. There must be 2 players (Black & White)
2. Black always goes first.
3. Place Go pieces on the intersections of the grid lines.
4. Game pieces cannot be removed from the board once placed.
5. The objective is to connect 5 game pieces in a row first.
6. Horizontal, vertical, and diagonal connections are all considered a win.

### Tips for beginners:

1. Always watch for an open three.
2. Always block a four.
3. Avoid placing pieces on the edges of the board. You might get a three or a four that is already blocked.
4. You don't always have to block an open three. If you could create a four, your opponent has to block that four first before they could attempt any fuhter attacks with 
an open three they just created. Sometimes attacking can be the best defense.
5. Be strategic. Typical winning move is to create an open three and a four in one move.

GL & HF!
